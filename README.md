# 🔗 Linked List Visualizer

An interactive React-based web application that **visualizes how a singly linked list works**. Users can add, reset, and observe the live structure of a linked list, helping learners and recruiters alike understand data structures through UI.

Adapted from the original C-style Linked List code in my GitHub repo below:
